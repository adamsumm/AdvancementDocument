	abstract={
                  Creating programs that can play games such as chess,
                  checkers, and backgammon, at a high level has long
                  been a challenge and benchmark for AI.  Typically,
                  each such program is designed to play a single game:
                  today's best chess-playing programs cannot play
                  checkers, or even tic-tac-toe.  \emph{General} Game
                  Playing is the problem of designing an agent capable
                  of playing many different previously unseen games.
                  The first AAAI General Game Playing Competition was
                  held at AAAI 2005 in order to promote research in
                  this area.  In this article, we survey some of the
                  issues involved in creating a general game playing
                  system and introduce our entry to that event.  The
                  main feature of our approach is a novel method for
                  automatically constructing effective search
                  heuristics based on the formal game description.
                  Our agent is fully implemented and tested in a range
                  of different games.

	abstract = {Stealthy movement is an important part of many games in the First Person Shooter (FPS) and Role Playing Games (RPG) genres.  Structuring a game level to match stealth goals, however, is difficult, and can depend on subtle and fragile interactions between the game space, enemy motion, and other factors. Here we apply a probabilistic path-finding approach to efficiently analyze a 2D space and find stealthy paths. This approach naturally accommodates variation in the level design, numbers and movements of enemies, fields of view, and player start and goal placement. Our design is integrated directly into the Unity 3D game development framework, allowing for interactive and highly dynamic exploration of how different virtual spaces and enemy configurations affect the potential for stealthly movement by players, or other NPCs.},
